<h3>Big 5 personality test<h3>
<img src=big5personalitytest.jpg alt=personalpic width="700" height="333">
<p>I have reflected about the results of the test; the test has enabled me to understand my personality and training styles on a deeper level.  Although I do not agree with all the results, it has helped me understand the different traits, strengths and weaknesses and areas in which I can work on to improve personally and professionally.</p>
<p>The results have made me aware of the different personalities and training styles and what behaviours which will result in my being a better team player.     </p>
<p>The results of this test will likely influence the position I am picked or volunteer for in a team.  It has shown what position I would be better suited for.  I can use the results to understand what other personality traits would be better suited for other positions in the team.</p>
<h1>Project – Overview </h1>
<p>The project I have considered is an app called ‘Travel Mate’.  For this assignment, I will focus on one component of the app which is fuel finder.  This app is designed to assist solo travellers traveling by car.  The fuel finder component would show to the driver, where they can find local petrol stations on route.  This app would be integrated with software that would search all available fuel stations on a particular route for e.g. The user would plot out their journey, the app would search through all fuel stations on or nearby street addresses, enabling the user to have current information that is assisted using technology. </p>
<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>According to the Motor Vehicle Census, Australia, there were 20.1 million registered motor vehicles as of 31 January 2021 and an increase in registrations was reported in all states and territories. Ref (Motor Vehicle Census, Australia 2021). According to amazingaustralia.com.au “There are over 800,000kms of roads criss-crossing Australia. Less than 50 percent are sealed. Highway One circumnavigates Australia and is 24,000kms long, the coastline is about 36,735 km. It takes three days to cross Australia by train and five hours by plane, the country measures approximately 4,000 km from east to west and 3,200 km from north to south”. Ref (amazingaustralia.com.au) Because Australia is such a large country and with some state like Queensland having warning signs of distances up to 560km between fuel stops an app like Travel mate will help travellers feel comfortable traveling around Australia.  Not to mention future possibilities of Travel mate moving into other countries.    </p>
<h1>Description </h1>
<p>There will be many services Travel Mate will provide though as stated in the overview.  I will be focusing on the Fuel finder component.  The user will be able to set up a personal account on the app and while setting up the account and because there are many types of vehicles in Australia i.e., electric, petrol, diesel. The user will be able to select what type of vehicle, make and model they will be using for their travel. The user will be able to pre-select the distance they are comfortable traveling before stopping for services. The Fuel Finder component of travel mate would provide the user with the most effective route and would highlight (by a flash warning on screen) to the user if there were limited resources in the area or longer distances between services set by the user. </p>
<h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
<p>Some of the tools I will need to consider is a map service, types of storage, app development software, given I will have no maps data, I would consider using a third-party service like Google maps. The app will process a large amount of data so cloud storage would be my choice of storage. Currently, I do not have skills in app development and coding, so I would consider approaching a professional using sites such as www.bark.com/app-development regarding the development of the app. I could put together a team, with some team members highly experienced in app development.  Alternatively, I could use open-source app development software such as Flutter or Ionic. Lastly the end user will need a smart phone to access the service.  </p>
<h1>Skills required</h1>
<p>The major hurdle I will face with developing the app is my lack of coding experience., If I am to choose an open-source app development software I will need to do extensive study and training with that software.  I will need to consider feasibility and costs regarding the use of third-party software, i.e., Google maps and cloud storage.  </p>
<h1>Outcome</h1>
<p>If this project were to be successful, experienced, and first-time travellers will have an app that is easy to use with sense of security while traveling around Australia on long journeys. There are similar apps available across all operating systems like wikicamps Australia and Campermate however, none of these services provide a service like Fuel Finder.      </p>
